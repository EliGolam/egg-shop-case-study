        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>With a shared love for the universally coveted egg sandwich, husband/wife team Sarah Schneider and Demetri
            Makoulis alongside chef Nick Korbee opened the first Egg Shop outpost in 2014, in the Soho neighborhood of
            New
            York City. Inspired by the incredible versatility of the egg, the team went on to develop infinite
            egg-centric
            dishes that are both familiar and nuanced. Today, Korbee executes a seasonal menu of organic, locally
            sourced
            dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner at both their cozy SoHo location and more spacious outpost in
            Williamsburg, Brooklyn (opened in 2017) – paired with fresh juices, creative & refreshing cocktails, and a
            selection of organic and biodynamic wines. Eggheads everywhere can now recreate the restaurant’s signature
            bowls, sandwiches, and breakfast cocktails with Egg Shop: The Cookbook (released in 2017). Maintaining Egg
            Shop’s signature playful-yet-minimalist aesthetic, the book comically and thoroughly guides readers through
            all
            egg-cooking techniques and provides recipes for more than 100 inventive egg-centric dishes.</p>
